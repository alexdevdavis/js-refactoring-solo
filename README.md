# Refactoring Exercise

## 👋 Introduction

This code produces sales information about transactions. Given an input set of data such as this:

```
['notebook', 'notebook', 'mouse', 'keyboard', 'mouse']
```

It produces a summary of what items have been purchased and how many of each item.

The results are sorted by the number of transactions, then alphabetically.

```
['mouse 2', 'notebook 2', 'keyboard 1'].
```

Unfortunately, the code is not in an ideal state...
