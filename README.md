# Refactoring Exercise

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to the exercise 😊

This code produces sales information about transactions. Given an input set of data such as this:

```
['notebook', 'notebook', 'mouse', 'keyboard', 'mouse']
```

It produces a summary of what items have been purchased and how many of each item.

The results are sorted by the number of transactions, then alphabetically.

```
['mouse 2', 'notebook 2', 'keyboard 1'].
```

Unfortunately, the code is not in an ideal state...

### 🗒️ Instructions

✅ Please work through and refactor the provided code, keeping notes on what you change and why.

✅ We'd like you to talk through your changes with us for about 5 minutes. This will be informal and relaxed!

✅ We're interested in how you present your ideas, and why you made your changes - in other words, what makes for good code in your eyes?

💡 You can use whatever tools you prefer - slides, live code refactoring, talking through files in VS Code.

✅ Note that all of the unit tests are currently passing, and they should continue to pass after you've made your changes.

🙌 Have fun and happy coding! 😊
